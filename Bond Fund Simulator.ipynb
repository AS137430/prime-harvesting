    "* Real funds [shift their durations all the time][3], even if only by small amounts. Our simulated shifts and their actual shifts are unlikely to line up exactly.\n",

    "# Bond Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "A bond is just three things: a yield, a face value, and a maturity. If you called up your broker you would say, \"I want to buy $100 of the 10-year Treasury that is yielding 3.2%.\" The maturity is 10-years; the face value is $100; and the yield is 3.2%.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only two things you can do with a bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Receive your payment\n",
    "Every year the bond will generate a payment -- a \"coupon\" in bond-speak. This is simply the **yield Ã— face value**. Going back to the previous example, with a face value of $100 and a yield of 3.2%, every year you would get a payment of $3.20. (Not very impressive, admittedly.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check the current value of the bond\n",
    "Bonds are designed to be held until their maturity. At that point you'll receive a payment for the face value. In our example, that would mean after holding the bond for 10 years you would get your full $100 back.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you wanted to sell the bond **before** maturity? That's (usually) possible but the exact price will depend on current rates. Say we want to sell our bond after 9 years. In essence, we have a 1-year bond that yields 3.2%. What if the current going yield for 1-year bonds was 2.5%? Then our bond will be worth a little more. If the current going yield for 1-year bonds is 4.2% then our bond will be worth a little less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it actually gets calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* take the current maturity remaining on the bond\n",
    "* take the current yield on bonds of that maturity\n",
    "* take the bond face value\n",
    "\n",
    "Then mix all of them into present value calculation: **pv(current yield, current maturity, face value)**. (The pv function is found in every spreadsheet and many calculators.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the current yields are 2.5% and you have a face value of $100 then the present value is $97.56. This calculates the \"exact\" value of the bond. In the real world, someone would probably offer you slightly less, maybe $97.25, because they are offering you liquidity and taking some risk. For Treasuries that is a very small number, so ignoring it is probably good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From rates to returns\n",
    "At the end of the day, checking the current value of the bonds we hold is what we're trying to achieve. By adding up the value of all the bonds we hold we can figure out the Net Asset Value (NAV) of our fund. And then we compare that NAV over time. This is what we wanted: to be able to calculate the returns of a (simulated) bond fund."
