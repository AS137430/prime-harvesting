HOW TO FIND SecId and DataId												
												
Typical approach for SecId (fund, ETF or individual security):												
	- search the fund/security symbol on Morningstar											
	- display the 'chart' page (use the mutual fund display, not the ETF display)						http://quotes.morningstar.com/chart/fund/chart?t=XXX&region=usa&culture=en_US					
	- restrict to the item of interest, removing benchmarks from the chart's display											
	- copy the Share URL in a text file (e.g. Notepad)											
	- deep in there, you'll find the id, something like: id%22%3A%22FOUSA00FQU											
	- to sanity check that this is indeed the right data series, you can use the secId in lieu of the fund symbol in the chart URL regular query											
												
Another possible approach for tough cases:												
	- search the symbol on Morningstar											
	- display the 'quote' page											
	- visualize the page source code (MacOS: View, Developer, View Source)											
	- search for 'SecId'											
												
Index SecId:	- go to Morningstar's home page, skip annoying ads											
	- use keywords in the search box to find TR or GR series (for total returns)											
	- look at 'View All Results', then 'View All US Securities Results' when results are ambiguous											
	- it takes a bit of practice due to strange abbreviations (e.g. BbgBarc for Bloomberg Barclays)...											
												
												
Known Dataid:	8225	Index only (Total Return)										
	117	Index, mutual fund or ETF or individual security (Total Return)										
	8217	Index, mutual fund or ETF or individual security (Price only)										
												
	8211	Total Returns WITHOUT subtracting the expense ratio					(hence a way to derive old expenses ratios, works as far as the security goes, better than M* Direct!)					
	8233	Market cap for securities (in absolute $)										
	9390	SEC Yield
