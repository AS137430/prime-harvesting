    """ This is a PMT-based method with a set of controls.
    up_threshold: how far your portfolio needs to differ from the "optimal amount" before you
        adjust to a higher withdrawal rate.

        'In isolation, the upward threshold has the greater impact on the probability of ruin,
        suggesting that upward thresholds would be the first control to install in reducing
        the probability of ruin. Upward thresholds of deviation above 1.4, however,
        yield only modest reductions in the probability of ruin as higher upward
        thresholds decrease the probability of ruin at a decreasing rate.'

        Note: an upward threshold of 1.4 means the portfolio needs to increase by
        1 + 1.4 = 2.4 its original value. That is, more than double.

    down_threshold: how far your portfolio needs to differ before you
        adjust to a higher withdrawal rate. If this is less than 0 then you delay reacting to bad news.
        If this is greater than 0, it means you "overreact" and keep a buffer.

    upward_rate_adjustment: how much of the upward adjustment to use: All of it? Only part?

    downward_rate_adjustment: how much of the downward adjustment to use

    ceiling_rate: the maximum withdrawal percentage. Stout & Mitchell say this
        doesn't really have any effect, since only super successful portfolios
        ever hit it.

    floor_rate: the minimum withdrawal percentage. Set it as low as you can tolerate.

    The "optimal portfolio size" is the present value required to maintain your
    current withdrawal rate until your expected death.

    With the defaults: When your current portfolio is 1.4x the "optimal" portfolio,
    you adjust the rate upwards; but you only get 20% of the upward adjustment.
    When you drop below the "optimal" portfolio, you make the downward adjustment
    immediately and fully.

    This means you are conservative: react immediately to bad news, take your time
    reacting to good news and don't take all of the upside.
